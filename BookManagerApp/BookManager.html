        <p>I am going to design and develop a book manager application. 
            Before jumping into the details of the application, just a small background as to why I want to create this application.</p>

        <p>I like to read books. I visit book stores regularly and buy one or two books.
            Out of my busy schedule, I don't get lot of time to read books. Even though there are many books which I am yet to read, I continue to buy new books.
            So what happens is the older books which I am yet to read go into the book rack and I just fail to notice them.                        
        </p>

        <div>
            <img width="500px" height="500px" oncontextmenu="return false" src="../Images/BookManager/BookRack.jpg">
        </div>

        <p>
            To avoid this problem, I want to create a book manager app to list and maintain all the books that I have purchased.                        
        </p>

        <p>
            I am planning to implement below features in the web app.
        <ol>
            <li>List all the purchased books</li>
            <li>Add a new book</li>
            <li>Update the book status. (Yet to Start, Started, Finished, OnHold)</li>
        </ol>
        </p>  
        
        <p>In the next article we will discuss about the design of the application. </p>
